                <h2>Captain America</h2>
                <p>The original and most well-known incarnation of Captain America is Steve Rogers. Rogers was a frail
                    young man who, after volunteering for a top-secret military experiment, was transformed into the
                    pinnacle of human <b>physical perfection</b>, known as Captain America. Armed with an indestructible <b>shield</b>
                    and enhanced physical abilities, Captain America fought against the Axis powers during World War II
                    as a symbol of American patriotism and heroism.

                    After being frozen in ice at the end of the war, Captain America was revived decades later and
                    became a key member of the superhero team known as the Avengers. Throughout his comic book history,
                    Captain America has remained a steadfast defender of justice, often portrayed as a moral compass for
                    other heroes.</p>
