                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Iron Man is the superhero persona of Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark, a businessman and engineer who runs
                    the weapons manufacturer <b>Stark Industries</b>. When Stark is captured in a war zone and sustains a
                    serious heart wound, he builds his iconic <b>Iron Man armor</b> out of scrap and escapes his captors. As a
                    superhero, his armor suits grant him <b>superhuman</b> strength, flight, energy projection, and other
                    abilities. The character was used to explore political themes, and early Iron Man stories were set
                    in the Cold War. Later stories explored other themes, such as civil unrest, technological
                    advancement, corporate espionage, alcoholism, and governmental authority.</p>
