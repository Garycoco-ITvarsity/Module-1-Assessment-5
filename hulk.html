                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>The Hulk is the alter ego of Dr. Bruce Banner, a brilliant scientist who, after being exposed to
                    <b>gamma radiation</b> in a laboratory accident, transforms into a massive, <b>green-skinned</b>
                    humanoid monster
                    whenever he experiences <b>extreme emotions</b>, particularly <b>anger or stress</b>. As the Hulk, Banner
                    possesses incredible superhuman strength, durability, and regenerative abilities, making him one of
                    the most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe.

                    Despite his <b>immense power</b>, the Hulk is often portrayed as a tragic figure, struggling with the dual
                    identities of Banner and the Hulk and the collateral damage his rampages can cause. Throughout his
                    comic book history, the Hulk has been both a hero and a misunderstood outcast, often finding himself
                    at odds with other superheroes and government agencies.
