                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Thor (from Old Norse: Þórr) is a <b>prominent</b> god in Germanic paganism. In Norse mythology, he is
                    a
                    <b>hammer-wielding</b> god associated with <b>lightning</b>, <b>thunder</b>, <b>storms</b>,
                    <b>sacred groves and trees</b>, <b>strength</b>, the
                    protection of humankind, hallowing, and fertility. Besides Old Norse Þórr, the deity occurs in Old
                    English as Þunor ("Thunor"), in Old Frisian as Thuner, in Old Saxon as Thunar, and in Old High
                    German as
                    Donar, all ultimately stemming from the Proto-Germanic theonym *Þun(a)raz, meaning 'Thunder'.
